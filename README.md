Kindle VNC Server & Client
=======================

Simple VNC-like server and client for Kindle 3+ using plain old HTML. However, it does not use the RFB protocol, but a series of PNG frames.

## Requirements

 - Python 3
 - Pillow

## Usage

Run `./server.py [port]` and connect to `http://[local_address]:5900` using your Kindle's web browser. For configuration options look at the top of the `server.py` file.
